//What is Spring Framework

//In 2000 if we want to create a java project we have to use lot of Java EE features to create an 
enterprise level project 

//EJB

//Jakarta Enterprise Beans one of several API's for modular level construction of enterprise software 
//EJB is a server-side software component that encapsulates business logic of an application

//problem is difficult to management entities that are heavy at enerprise level 


//People came up with POJO and included that in Spring Framework


//Spring features

POJO
Dependency Injection
MVC
REST
Security
Batch
Data
AOP

//it can integrate with other frameworks like Hibernate and Struts 

//for enterprise level application we have to work with JAR files and the configuration 

//if we are working on a project we have to focus on convention basically coding rather than the configuration part

//SprinBoot helps developers to take care of the JAR files management and configuration part 

//SpringBoot provides us the production ready code 



Server with hardware and OS on top of that we can install our tomcat service to build a server 

tomcat is a webserver 

on the tomcat server we deploy our App(WAR) file we used to build the web application 

//now-a-days we are moving towards microservices 
//Springboot don't need to do this all by ourselves

//SprinBoot will embed the tomcat server inside the jar files so that is why it will have the embedded tomcat server 


//so we donot need any web server so 

//spring-boot-starter-web
//spring-boot-starter-jdbc

//spring boot also has the autoconfiguration which will do the autoconfiguration for us
//spring boot will not generate any xml file for us 

//so we had special file where we can add the properties we needed to add 

//application.properties where we can add the properties we want to add
